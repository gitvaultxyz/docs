## What is GitVault?

GitVault is a censorship-resistant & automated backup tool for your codebases on centralized Git platforms. GitVault automaitcally backs up your codebases based on pre-defined triggers in the Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) of your choice. All the storage deals are orchestrated by GitVault to make sure that your data is perpetually available to you. With GitVault, you can rest assured that your codebases are safe from censorship and other threats.

## In a nutshell

- **Automated workflows**: GitVault configures automated workflows to enable CI
- **Setup within 3 clicks**: Setting up GitVault is as easy as 1-2-3
- **Web3 powers with a web2 experience**: Using GitVault is as easy as using GitHub
- **Pick your DSN**: GitVault is built to support multiple DSNs, including Filecoin, Codex & Arweave (coming soon)
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks with copy functionality
- **Private repositories**: With the power of Threshold Access Control, your private codebases are safe from prying eyes (coming soon)
- **Notifications**: GitVault optionally sends you a heads-up on Email/Slack/Discord when your codebase is backed up

## But, why GitVault?

The world of web3 is still in its infancy. While we are making strides in decentralizing the internet with various protocols, most of the 'web3' projects use GitHub for version control and code collaboration. GitHub is a centralized platform and is susceptible to censorship and other threats. Shifting to a completely decentralized code collaboration platform is daunting for projects as they not only have to deal with the complexity of setting up and migrating their codebase but also loose a great portion of their community visibility in the web2 audience. 

GitVault is exactly trying to solve this problem by briding the vaules of web3 with the ease of use of web2.
